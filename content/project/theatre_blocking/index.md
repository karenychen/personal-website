Theatre blocking is a simple web application to improve efficiency during the planning stage and rehearsals of a performance. The application's target users include directors and actors.

[Directors](https://chenka51-linkexi1-theatre.herokuapp.com/director.html) have access to view and edit all parts of the script. And [actors](https://chenka51-linkexi1-theatre.herokuapp.com/actor.html) have access to view their own part of the script. Moreover, a stage visualizer feature on both directors and actors' page provides users with a more intuitive graphical aspect to actors' movement on stage.
